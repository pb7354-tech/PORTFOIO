						Welcome to my academic portfolio on <strong>Helical Computed Tomography (CT)</strong>, 
						developed as part of the Advanced Medical Imaging Systems coursework. 
						This project explores the principles, instrumentation, and clinical applications of Helical CT—an 
						advanced imaging technique that provides rapid, high-resolution, 3D diagnostic images.

			<section class="panel spotlight medium right" id="project">
				<div class="content span-7">
					<h2 class="major">Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						Helical Computed Tomography (CT) is a diagnostic imaging technique that continuously acquires 
						data as the X-ray tube rotates around the patient while the table moves through the gantry. 
						This produces a helical or spiral data path, allowing volumetric datasets to be reconstructed 
						into three-dimensional images. It has transformed radiology by enabling rapid scanning and 
						reducing motion artifacts.
					</p>
					<h2 class="major">Background</h2>
					<p>
						Developed in the late 1980s, Helical CT revolutionized medical imaging by replacing traditional 
						step-and-shoot CT scanners. Slip-ring technology allowed continuous gantry rotation, enabling 
						uninterrupted data collection. Later, multi-detector CT (MDCT) systems improved efficiency 
						by capturing multiple slices per rotation, enhancing image resolution and diagnostic accuracy.

			<!-- Panel 3: Working & Instrumentation -->
			<section class="panel spotlight large left">
				<div class="content span-7">
					<h2 class="major">Working Mechanism</h2>
					<p>
						The X-ray tube and detector rotate synchronously around the patient as the table moves 
						smoothly through the gantry. Data is collected in a spiral pattern and reconstructed 
						using algorithms like filtered back projection or iterative reconstruction. This enables 
						high-speed imaging with minimal motion artifacts and improved spatial resolution.
					</p>
					<h2 class="major">Instrumentation</h2>
					<p>
						A Helical CT system includes an X-ray tube, detector array, slip rings, gantry, and 
						patient couch. Slip rings ensure continuous power transmission, while solid-state 
						detectors capture X-ray photons and convert them into digital signals. 
						Modern scanners also employ automatic exposure control to reduce radiation dose.

			<!-- Panel 4: Applications & Future Scope -->
			<section class="panel spotlight large right">
				<div class="content span-7">
					<h2 class="major">Applications</h2>
					<p>
						Helical CT is used for brain, chest, and abdominal imaging. 
						It plays a crucial role in detecting trauma, tumors, and vascular diseases, 
						and is essential in CT angiography, cardiac imaging, and oncology. 
						The technology’s speed and accuracy make it indispensable for emergency diagnosis and 
						3D surgical planning.
					</p>

					<h2 class="major">Advantages</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Fast and continuous image acquisition.</li>
						<li>High-resolution 3D imaging capability.</li>
						<li>Reduced motion artifacts and radiation dose.</li>
						<li>Improved patient comfort and diagnostic confidence.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2 class="major">Future Scope</h2>
					<p>
						Future advancements in Helical CT include the integration of photon-counting detectors 
						and AI-based image reconstruction. These will enable ultra-low-dose, high-contrast imaging, 
						enhancing diagnostic precision and supporting personalized healthcare.
